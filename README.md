# Accounts-Manager

An app designed to keep all your accounts information into one place.

## Why tho?

Everyone recommends to use a different password for every site that you are creating an account on. And they are RIGHT.

It's safer to have multiple accounts with multiple passwords but it can become really hard to keep track of them all so you need a place to actually store and keep track of your accounts.

## How it works.

This app at first, requires you to add manually the accounts.
It stores the data into an encrypted file, localy on your device.
The information is decrypted only when you are using the app.
You can never see all the information into the file, it shows you only one account at the time, the one that you are requesting. It's safer this way.
